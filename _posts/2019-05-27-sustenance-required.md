The focus on this drawing was to get the gesture, construction and refinement layered. I started the drawing a little too close to the top, and didn't include the chair the model was leaning on, making it look weirdly floating.

My next drawing attempted to provide more info in the scene, but I didn't get enough time to complete the whole drawing. I feel like I'm making progress on the tone and shading aspects, in order to give my drawing some volume.

### 02 - *The Longest Pose*
#### 35 minutes

With 35 minutes, there was ample opportunity to really drill in the detail into the drawing. This time I used a quick 'triangle' map to approximate the area that the model would take. I was quite pleased with the facial features in this drawing, as I usually don't have time to add it in.

I had also added the platform the model was sitting on to gound my drawing. I think my shading really brought the drawing out a bit, although some areas of the drawing, notibly the right hand side arm, looks a little off.
