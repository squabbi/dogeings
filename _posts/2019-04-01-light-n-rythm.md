## Homework
#### Drawing Insertion and Origin Points of the Sternocleidomastoid and Pectoralis Major Muscles

I spent some time on the skull's details, but rushed the ribcage. Showing the connection of the Sternocleidomastoid was a little difficult in getting the twists and turns that it had. I felt like the spine would take too much away from the muscles themselves.

The Pectoralis Major drawing wasn't able to capture the detailed weaving and wrapping the muscles have between the insertion and origin points. I could have made it smaller to be able to fit in more detail.

## 01 - Rythm Drawings
#### 5 Minutes Per Pose

Most of the body's features wern't defined, it seems like a giant blob. I do like how some of the limbs had turned out, where they would connect, between the joints of the legs and in some, the arms.

## 02 - Using Colour & Tone
#### 5 Minutes Per Pose

I was surprised that this was done in 5 minutes. The model was sitting, but I didn't have time to do the feet. This time I tried adding the shadow of the seat, and left the light areas without any colour. I liked how it turned out.

## 03 - Cont. Colour & Tone
#### 10 Minutes Per Pose

The left butt seems a little too big, although I like the 'depth' in the image, as the model was stepping forward. I feel if I had drawn him a little bigger, I could add in more detail. Especially where body parts overlap (i.e. the hands and the arm).
