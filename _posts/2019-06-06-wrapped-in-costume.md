## Life Drawing Reflection

Maybe because I'm doing mostly technical IT work, and not something like animation, game design or even things related to graphics. I do think that Life Drawing has provided me with some good pointers for life. Looking at things wholly, and with objectivity, and most of all, *patience*. These classes, anatomy studies have really helped me learn and visualise what's underneath the skin.

This has been a valuable experience in another field of study, and something I can take into other disciplines.

### 01 - Medium Poses
#### 10, 10, 20 minutes respectively

Time got the better of me for the 10 minute poses, some of the shading on the thighs could have been done a little better, to show the roundness, and not just the darkness of the thighs.

In the last pose, I tried adding colour to it, to highlight the 'light' areas instead of only having the shadows.

### 02 - Costume Time
#### 10, 10, 15 minutes respectively

I had spent a little too long on getting the costume's folds, etc. rather than the full body first, then adding in the extra details. But with an extra 5 minutes, I was able to add in the full body, whilst putting in the details.

The last pose still seemed rather flat, with no real volume/depth to it. The details were there, but the person looked flimsy and a little disproportionate.

### 03 - Costume Time Part 2
#### 5 minutes per pose

These are really quick drawings, there's a balance in completeness and issues between the two. But I fell there was a mix in proportions on the right drawing, I couldn't really capture the angle that the model was actually facing.

I guess it was a little challenging trying to capture this much detail, in 5 minutes, and I drew a little small in these two.
