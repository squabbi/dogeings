With the feedback from my previous muscle drawings, I tried a different approach in drawing the muscle fibre connections, with more distinct lines instead of trying to shade in the twists. It does feel still a bit empty (in terms of muscle volume), especially with the Trapezius muscle, since it spans such a large proportion of the back.
