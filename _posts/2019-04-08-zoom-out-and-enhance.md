## Homework
#### Drawing Insertion and Origin Points of the Deltoid and Trapezius Muscles

With the feedback from my previous muscle drawings, I tried a different approach in drawing the muscle fibre connections, with more distinct lines instead of trying to shade in the twists. It does feel still a bit empty (in terms of muscle volume), especially with the Trapezius muscle, since it spans such a large proportion of the back.

## 01 - Thumbmail Gestures
#### 20 Seconds per Pose

Perhaps these are too small. Next time I'll try to make these larger, but that could prove difficult due to the time constraints. The line of action seems even-more important here. The later gestures had more of a person feeling to it. These are hard to do!

## 02 - Longer Drawings
#### 10 Minutes per Pose

This is when I was shown a new way to shade, where instead of just plainly shading the darker/shadow areas, I would wrap that light/shadow around the volume of the body. This really brought out some of the curves of the body in the drawing on the right.

I spent more time thinking about the light and shadows which hit the model. There were still some issues with proportion, but I think when it came to applying the shading, it was much more detailed and looks way less flat.
