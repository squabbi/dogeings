## Homework
#### Drawing Insertion and Origin Points of the Latissimus Dorsi and External Obliques Muscles

I could work a little less on the bones' shading as the main focus is the muscle. The muscles drawn on the External Oblique are drawn with the same strength, which doesn't show it's complexity unlike the Latissimus Dorsi drawing.

## 01 - Continious Movement
#### 2 Minutes per Sequence

It was quite hard to take that mental snapshot of the model's position since he was in constant motion. Being able to recall an exact position is hard, but it may be possible to grab the line of action, and important limbs, and from there fill in the gaps.

## 02 - Longer Poses
#### 15 Minutes per Pose

Getting the depth & perspective right, especially on a twisted pose I found was quite difficult. Lily was able to show me a way to deconstruct what I saw, rather than what I thought I saw. Being able to indentify a place to start, then directly translating what I saw to the paper was a huge step. There was a noticible difference between the left and right images.

## 03 - Clothed Snapshots
#### 30 Seconds per Snapshot

Adding clothing is very interesting. It definitely adds a different dimension of flow and power to the pose. Getting so much extra detail down in such a short time is a challenge, but I can see the extra action portrayed (i.e. #5).
