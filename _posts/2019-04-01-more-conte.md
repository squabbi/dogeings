Another week with a fine selection of pages.

## 01 - Rythm Drawings
#### 5 Minutes Per Pose

Most of the body's features wern't defined, it seems like a giant blob. I do like how some of the limbs had turned out, where they would connect, between the joints of the legs and in some, the arms.

## 02 - Using Colour & Tone
#### 5 Minutes Per Pose

I was surprised that this was done in 5 minutes. The model was sitting, but I didn't have time to do the feet. This time I tried adding the shadow of the seat, and left the light areas without any colour. I liked how it turned out.

## 03 - Cont. Colour & Tone
#### 10 Minutes Per Pose

The left butt seems a little too big, although I like the 'depth' in the image, as the model was stepping forward. I feel if I had drawn him a little bigger, I could add in more detail. Especially where body parts overlap (i.e. the hands and the arm).
