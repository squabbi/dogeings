I've selected a few pages from this week's work.

## 01 - Line and Tone
#### 1 Minute Per Drawing

I thought that there was good flow and tone with the two drawings on the right. Although time was quite short so I wasn't able to capture the feet. This doesn't give weight to the person. I'll ensure that I start with the feet to give my drawing a 'leg to stand on', so to speak.

## 02 - Extended Still
#### 15 Minute Drawing

Again, the feet are gone! I decided to put more detail in the hands and torso. I've attempted to do some shading where the shadows would go. Some of the proportions are a little off, I'm thinking of the right sholder. Time went very quickly for this drawing.

## 03 - Extended Still
#### 15 Minute Drawing

This one did have feet, but my toning and shading was too similar, or didn't have enough variations of shade, so it made it hard to add the extra detail. The person is quite small on my page, I felt like the proportions were still off by this one.
