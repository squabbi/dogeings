This week's homework during stuvac was to draw up 100 thumbnail gestures. I found it especially relaxing, and it wasn't as easy as I thought it could have been, since people like to move a lot. It's a lot different to having a model hold a pose for you.

Below are my 100. A majority of them were done in one sitting, but a total of 2 days was taken to complete all 100.

#### Thumbnail Sketches

{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'img/220419' %}
<div>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" width="800" alt="image" />
</div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
