Welcome to the first post! Here you'll find humble beginnings of my works on Still Life. I do think of myself on the creative side, but I've never really took the time to draw people and their bodies. ðŸ˜Š

## 01 - The Benchmark
#### 10 Minutes / Normal

This was a 10 minute drawing of a relatively simple pose, no crazy lighting, nothing too out there, but judging from the result, it definitely was not easy.

This will be something to look back on at the end of semester.

### Mirror, mirror, on the wall...
He looks a little flat, somewhat chunky like a gingerbread man. The proportions were not too right on this one. He doesn't even have a neck! There was a lack of shadowing to indicate some kind of depth to it, hence my alluding to him looking quite flat.

If I recall, this was probably the longest 10 minutes of my life. I didn't feel pressured to draw faster or anything like that. I was able to 'take my time', but at the same time, I didn't know where to start with my time.

He does look chunky on the page, so proportions would be something to work on.

## 02 - Thrice the Charm
#### 5 Minutes Per Pose / Normal

These poses were 5 minutes each.

### Mirror, mirror, on the wall...
The first 2 poses I was still trying to get a footing into proportioning the model correctly. They still looked a little rigid, as our instructor had mentioned, our minds love things that look structured, solid and straight.

But after drawing the third time, I could really see the defining shapes for the limbs, particularly the thighs and to some degree the arms. Although there wasn't much detail overall, I felt like the shaping of the model made up for that.

The torso does still look a bit blockly, but I swear it really looked like that! ðŸ˜…

## 03 - Gesture Me
#### 2, 1 (Minutes), 45, 30 Seconds Per Pose / Gesture

</p>

Gesture was fun to do. Freeform, and you just have to let it flow! Feel the model with your pencil.

My initial gestures were to heavy, it didn't really translate the volume and energy of the pose onto paper. It seemed like some really flat spaghetti on the page.

Going lighter and around the body shapes provided that dephth and volume needed for my gestures. In most of my subsiquent poses, I could see the volume of the body.

## 04 - Longer Poses
#### 12 Minutes Per Pose / Normal

<p align="center"><img src="/dogeings/assets/img/110319/11032019-p6.jpg" width="650"/></p>

To finish off, we returned to the longer poses, this time the model was sitting. I focused on different aspects in each drawing. The first one I wanted to work on the shadow detail a bit more. But in doing so, it sacraficed some of my proportioning, making his torso huge. The legs also don't seem too right, looking a bit like drumsticks.

In my second drawing, I found plotting certian points down on to the paper helped a lot with the positioning, which makes drawing the right length/size a little easier. I though that the detail seemed alright in this drawing.
